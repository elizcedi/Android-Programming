# Android-Programming
                                                Android Programming
Things to know before programming:
- Developing Android applications using Android Studio.
- Update user interface (UI) elements during runtime.
- Navigating directories in the command-line interface (CLI).
- Implement event handler interfaces by taking out the attributes of buttons in xml files. 
- Install the Android Studio and the Android SDK and configuring the SDK and Android Studio.
- Coding in event handlers to initialize the buttons in the Java code using the findViewById method.

 	Throughout the videos I learned the comparisons and differences between Java’s syntax and the Android implementation of Java’s syntax. The android platform is an open source, meaning it is browsable with google play for example. This makes the developers ecosystem dynamic and enriching. 
	The most basic building block of Android development is the programming language Java. To be a successful Android developer, one needs to be comfortable with Java concepts like loops, lists, variables, and control structures. Java is one of the most popular programming languages used by software developers today, so learning its ins and outs will stand one in good stead for work  beyond the Android platform.
	I learned the basics of SQL in order to organize the databases within the Android apps. SQL is a language expressing queries to retrieve information from databases. I also learned how to optimize Java code for Android and when to optimize my code.
	I also used the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and android studio.Android studio is the main program with which developers write code and assemble their apps from various packages and libraries. The XML is also helpful with using interface (UI) layouts and parsing data feeds from the internet.
	I also learned how to create new static method libraries by declaring new methods in a different class. This gives the method four parameters, and setting an if-else statement with a three-part Boolean.
